# Self care through time management

It can be hard to convince yourself to get things done. Sometimes that is spending time doing your hobbies other times it can be hard to convince yourself to be productive and do the things that you really need to be doing such as doing paperwork, studying or work related activities.

I myself have suffered with this a lot and in an effort to help myself I read lots of books on time management and have figured out things that actually work for me and I am hoping that I can help others by sharing.

The first step is to do a mind dump which I do with 2 methods. The first is to just write out everything I know I need to do onto a list on a computer.

I then once I have the majority of the tasks that I can think of out of my head I then close my eyes and try and blank my mind of all thoughts. You might manage it but rather quickly you will get something pop into your head. Check the list and see if it is on there. If it isn't add it. Then go back to blanking your mind and repeat until you can actually keep your mind blank for a reasonable amount of time.

Those thoughts that popped into your head are worries. Some of them you can do something about some you cannot.

The first thing you need to do is go through the list of worries and determine what can be realistically dealt with and which cannot have anything done about them.

Write the ones you cannot do anything about onto a piecce of paper and then burn it as it will make you feel better.

The other ones rearrange in order of priority and urgency. While doing this think about how each of these things may realistically take to do. If you find any that can be done in less than 2 minutes just do it immediately. This will give you an immediate dopamine hit and fuel you to want to get more done while also eliminating a worry.

Once you have this list sort the things with the same urgency and priority by the time you think they will take so that the things that take the shortest amount of time are first on the list.

Then when done with that you then need to open up a calendar that you can access from your phone (I use Google Calendar). Then create a calendar that you can use to block out the time where you are unavaiable due to work or travel to and from work and the other engagements you have.

Then create another calendar. Now where there is time free you can then allocate 80% of your time towards being productive and 20% of your time towards towards your hobbies and rest.

If you are finding you are feeling burned out though due to work tiring you out feel free to flip the 80 20 the other way and spend 80% of your time resting for a particular week and only 20% productive.

We are then going to borrow some things from the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). However we are going to only use it's rules as guidelines. The Pomodoro Technique as prescribed involves allocating blocks of time of 25 minutes to work on tasks and then after each 25 minute block you take a 5 minute break. Then after 4 of the 25m work blocks you take a 15 minute break instead of the 5 minute one.

However for people with ADHD or other concentration problems spending 25 minutes on one thing can be nearly impossible so I advise shrinking these time windows to time periods that are actually feasible for yourself.

I settled on 15m as being feasible for myself but then pushed myself to increase it back to 25m as I got used to concentrating on 1 task but do not feel guilty if you stay on the time period that you pick that works for you.

Please keep in mind that the idea is not to necessarily complete the task within your time box but instead to just make progress on it so do not beat yourself up for not completing the task.

The idea is to just make continuous progress towards completing the things that matter which in turn helps your mental health and completes the most important tasks to you.

I also recommend making use of the timers from the Pomodoro Technique for the following reason. If you have a timer that tells you that the time slot is over you do not need to worry about how long you are doing something just that you keep doing it without having
to worry that you are going to be late for something or should be doing something else as until that time goes off you know you are in the safe time to do that activity be that one of your important tasks or a hobby. This leads to you being able to concentrate harder on your tasks and relax more in your spare time.

For setting these timers I recommend making use of Google Assistant on your phone if you are on Android or Siri if you use an iPhone or a Mac as it is quick and easy to tell them set timers.

Time boxing like above helps you to ensure that you aren't burning yourself out by only working all the time. Never having time to rest and do your hobbies. This also allows you to combat your internal voices that say you must be doing something else when you are working or if you are doing your hobbies or resting as you have allocated time to do both.

Another important tip if you are prone to procrastination is to lie to yourself. By this I mean if you are procrastinating on a task tell yourself you are just going to do a couple of minutes or just write one sentence if it is a report. By doing this you can reduce the resistance you have on starting the task and once you have started you can then continue to lie to yourself repeatedly to keep going by just saying... just one more sentence and like when you do this when you are playing a game or doing something else you enjoy you will find that time flies and you end up realising that hours have passed and you have done more than you intended to do.
