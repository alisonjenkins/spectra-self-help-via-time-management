# Spectra Self Help via Time Management Article

This is an Article that I wrote for self help via time management for [Spectra](https://spectra-london.org.uk/).

This article's aim is to share the time management techniques and tools that work for me as someone who is autistic in the hope that others who are also autistic can make use of them to improve their lives.
